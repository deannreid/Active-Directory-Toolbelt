Automating the creation of user accounts in Active Directory and CyberArk involves scripting and leveraging the respective APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provided by these systems. Below, I'll outline a high-level approach using PowerShell for Active Directory and REST API for CyberArk. Please note that you need appropriate permissions to perform these tasks.

### Active Directory User Account Creation (PowerShell):

1. **Install Active Directory Module:**
   Ensure that the Active Directory Module is installed on the machine where you plan to run the script. You can install it using the following command:

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name ActiveDirectory
   ```

2. **Create User Account Script:**
   Here's a basic PowerShell script to create a user account in Active Directory:

   ```powershell
   # Import the Active Directory module
   Import-Module ActiveDirectory

   # Set user details
   $username = "NewUser"
   $password = "P@ssw0rd"
   $firstname = "John"
   $lastname = "Doe"
   $ou = "OU=Users,DC=domain,DC=com"

   # Create user
   New-ADUser -SamAccountName $username -UserPrincipalName "$username@domain.com" -Name "$firstname $lastname" -GivenName $firstname -Surname $lastname -Enabled $true -Path $ou -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force) -PassThru
   ```

   Customize the variables (`$username`, `$password`, `$firstname`, `$lastname`, `$ou`) based on your requirements.

### CyberArk User Account Creation (REST API):

1. **Generate API Token:**
   In CyberArk, generate an API token with the necessary permissions to create user accounts.

2. **Create User Account Script:**
   Use a tool like `Invoke-RestMethod` in PowerShell to interact with CyberArk's REST API. Below is a simplified example:

   ```powershell
   $apiUrl = "https://cyberark-instance/api/v1/accounts"
   $apiToken = "your_api_token_here"

   $headers = @{
       'Authorization' = "Bearer $apiToken"
       'Content-Type'  = 'application/json'
   }

   $body = @{
       'user' = 'newuser'
       'password' = 'P@ssw0rd'
       'additionalField' = 'value'  # Add any additional required fields
   } | ConvertTo-Json

   # Create user account
   $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $apiUrl -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body

   # Check the response
   if ($response.Success -eq $true) {
       Write-Host "User account created successfully."
   } else {
       Write-Host "Error: $($response.ErrorMessage)"
   }
   ```

   Replace the placeholder values in `$apiUrl` and `$apiToken` with your CyberArk instance URL and API token.

### Important Considerations:

- **Security:** Ensure that the scripts are stored securely, and sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API tokens) is handled appropriately.

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues during the user account creation process.

- **Testing:** Test the scripts in a controlled environment before deploying them in a production setting.

- **Logging:** Consider adding logging functionality to keep track of user account creation activities.

These scripts are basic examples, and you may need to modify them based on your organization's specific requirements and security policies.
